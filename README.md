## Installed Dependencies

### p5.js

[p5.js](http://p5js.org) is a Javascript library with the goal of making coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. It is a reinterpretation of [Processing](http://processing.org), by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, initiated by artist [Lauren McCarthy](http://www.lauren-mccarthy.com/).

## The problems

* The game doesn't contain a complex set of physics or collisions.
* The game can only be played on **screens wider than 800px** on a **web browser** on **full-screen mode** since screen responsiveness was not in mind when in development (beginner error).
* This project will likely **not** be revisited.
